Angular Questionnaire

Playground for an Angular 1.4 questionnaire project using WebApi Azure hosted backend and sailsjs equivalent.  Built with minimal initial tooling.

#### Prerequisites

1. Node (v4.5 or above if you want to run the server).  I recommend installing node using the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
2. [SailsJs](http://sailsjs.org/) (required if you want to run the server for persisting question boards).

#### Running the application

1. Clone the repository.
2. `npm install` (This will also install bower dependencies).
3. `npm start` (This will run the gulp build and live server form the dist directory).


4. To run the server open another terminal window and navigate to the `server/sailsjs` directory, then run `sails lift`.
